Project Name: Kubernetes Monitoring Service

Version: 1.0Author: [Your Name]Date: [Today's Date]

1. Executive Summary

The Kubernetes Monitoring Service aims to provide enhanced visibility into Kubernetes cluster resource utilization and efficiency. By leveraging the Kubernetes Metrics API, this tool will monitor compute, memory, and utilization metrics for nodes and pods, analyze historical data to recommend resource optimizations, and expose an API for querying metrics and recommendations. This service will be deployed as a DaemonSet for seamless integration and scalability and will feature a dashboard for real-time data visualization.

2. Goals and Objectives

2.1 Goals:

Provide detailed resource utilization insights for Kubernetes clusters.

Enable cluster administrators to optimize resource allocation through data-driven recommendations.

Simplify resource monitoring and optimization with an accessible API and user-friendly dashboard.

2.2 Objectives:

Collect and analyze real-time metrics using the Kubernetes Metrics API.

Process historical data to generate right-sizing recommendations.

Deploy as a DaemonSet to ensure coverage across all cluster nodes.

Visualize metrics and recommendations in an intuitive dashboard.
